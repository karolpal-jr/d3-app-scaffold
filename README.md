# d3-app-scaffold

Reusable code that helps me get a simple d3 app up and running. 

Contains:
  * Minimalistic HTML web page
  * Example data
  * Some basic d3 code which reads the data and plots dots onto an SVG
  * Live server with hot reloading (webpack-dev-server)

To get it up and running `clone` and `cd` into the repo. Inside the repo run `yarn` and `yarn start`. Visit your page at `localhost:8080` and you're ready to start editing the `main.js` file.
